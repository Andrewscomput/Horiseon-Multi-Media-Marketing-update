Horiseon multi marketing team has asked Me and my fellow codeing team to fix and update there website to attract more attention from the public. 
Here are the results of our updates and our challenges.
The first thing we did we fixed the navigation bar the far one to the left the ID was left out of the hyper link so we linked it and now all is well.
The second thing we did was fixed html sematics some of them were missing so we put all them in the place that they were needed.
The third thing we did was add comments to the html so future coders would be easily be able to navigate thru the html page.
The fourth thing we did is we gave all images a alt tribbute for accesability standards.
The fith thing we did was fix the side menu so that it lines up right with all the aricle sections.

Here is the completed updated webiste URL
